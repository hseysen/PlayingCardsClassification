# Playing Cards Classification
### About
This repository contains code that solves the [Playing Cards Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification) by training a **Resnet18** model. The repository is made for a laboratory work in Deep Learning class during my masters education in [Baku Higher Oil School](https://bhos.edu.az/) in Informatics and Control in Technical Systems.


### Task Specifications
The task in the laboratory work asks the student to use the **Resnet18** model as the feature extractor, and train the classifier according to the given data. The training and validation should be run for 20 epochs with three different configurations with learning rates of **1.5**, **0.5** and **0.00005**. The tensorboard logs should be included in the results, for the comparison of **Loss** and **F1 scores** of training and validation. The laboratory work also requires a report made in $` \LaTeX `$ format.
